<div class="bloc"><h1>Guards and Wards</h1><div class="trad">[ <a href="sorts.php?vf=protections-et-sceaux">Protections et sceaux</a> ]</div><div class="ecole">level 6 - abjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 10 minutes</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 24 hours</div><div class="description ">You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.<br />When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.<br /><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the warded area.<br /><strong>Corridors</strong>. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.<br /><strong>Doors</strong>. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=arcane-lock">arcane lock</a></em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=minor-illusion">minor illusion</a></em> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.<br /><strong>Stairs</strong>. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=web">web</a></em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.<br /><strong>Other Spell Effect</strong>. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.<br />• Place <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dancing-lights">dancing lights</a></em> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.<br />• Place <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=magic-mouth">magic mouth</a></em> in two locations.<br />• Place <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=stinking-cloud">stinking cloud</a></em> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.<br />• Place a constant <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a></em> in one corridor or room.<br />• Place a <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=suggestion">suggestion</a></em> in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.<br />The whole warded area radiates magic. A <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.<br />You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.<br /></div><div class='classe'>Bard</div><div class='classe'>Wizard</div><div class='source'>Player´s Handbook (SRD)</div><div class='ref'>&rarr; <strong><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/spells-5e.php">DnD 5e Spells</a></strong></div></div></div>				<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-346920-5"></script>
